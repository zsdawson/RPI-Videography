# ZSDawson-RPI-Timelapse
the goal of this reposotrry is to make the process of getting the timelapse code and the video code easy to all 

the **timelapse code** takes photos at a time that the user specifies for how ever long the user specifies and is then converted to video where those photos are put in a 30 Fps video 
curently the photos and video go to the RPI's internal video and photo files 
DISCLAIMER the photos for the timelapse will delete when a second timelapse is initiated 
the photos the RPI takes will have a curent hour and minute timestamp 

the **video code** will take a video for however long you specify in the code and will display the curent time while the video is playing and 
the product of this will go to the external SSD harddrive
