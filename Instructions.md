# ZSDawson-RPI-Timelapse

The goal of this repository is to make the process of getting the timelapse code 
and the video code easy to all 

The **Timelapse Code** takes photos at a time that the user specifies for how 
ever long the user specifies and is then converted to video where those photos 
are put in a 30 Fps video curently the photos and video go to the RPI's internal 
video and photo files DISCLAIMER the photos for the timelapse will delete when 
a second timelapse is initiated the photos the RPI takes will have a curent hour 
and minute timestamp 

The **Video Code** will take a video for however long you specify in the code 
and will display the curent time while the video is playing and the product of 
this will go to the external SSD harddrive 

## Implementation directions 

You should be able to take whichever code you would like and drag and drop the 
file onto the RPI then click of the file and once it loads in thonny you should 
be able to read the code change what you need and then press run code
